echo "/// The file is share on the open source licence, but unlike GPL, MIT, BSD"
echo "/// APACHE, L-GPL, etc,  it is NOT standard and NOT liberary licence of the"
echo "/// open source. By downloading and reading this file, you conclude a contract"
echo "/// with me. Namely, if you understand that my source code can be improved"
echo "/// (for example: speed up, better algorithms, better parametrs,  fixed"
echo "/// bugs, etc), you need to present me everything in very detail. You"
echo "/// can only download, read and compile this project only on the your"
echo "/// personal computer. You can run the executable file and solve"
echo "/// education or example problem, but only on the your own personal"
echo "/// computer. You can see what the genetic alghoritm work in any"
echo "/// practical multi-knapsack problem. However you can not use result"
echo "/// this project in the  business applications. You also can NOT modifi,"
